    <h2 class="heading">Sun is shining</h2>
    <p>When the sun is out the solar panels on your roof will be gathering elecrtical energy to feed back into the development. When there's more energy being produced than being used we'll reduce the price of electricity so anything you use during that time will be super cheap! We'll send you a message so you know when this happens so you'll be able to make the most of this ecological form of energy.</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Singing in the rain</h2>
    <p>The houses in Little Kelham are all fitted with water collection facilities which collect rain water ready to be used for flushing your toilet or for watering your garden. When enough water is available we'll reduce the price of water use so you get the full benefit of these facilities. A message will inform you when this happens and all your water uses (toilets and hoses) will be at half price during that period.</p>
